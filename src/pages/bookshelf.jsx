            <Tool title="IBM Model M SSK Industrial Keyboard">
              They dont make keyboards the way they used to. I buy these any
              time I see them go up for sale and keep them in storage in case I
              need parts or need to retire my main.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Apple Magic Trackpad">
              Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with

              I dont care if its missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
              else relies on, Sublime Text is still the best text editor ever
              made.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="iTerm2">
              Im honestly not even sure what features I get with this that
              aren’t just part of the macOS Terminal but its what I use.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="TablePlus">
              Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
              building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects

              We started using Figma as just a design tool but now its become
              our virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have
              expected the collaboration features to be the real hook.

            <Tool title="Reflect">
              Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
              organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
              Reflect, its still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
              discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
              daily note.
