humans are an api to chatgpt.
chatgpt is an api to python.
python is an api to c.
c is an api to assembly.
assembly is an api to binary.
binary is an api to physics.
physics is an api to machine that runs the universe.

it's all computation all the way down.

## ##explained

This statement is a way of expressing the idea that our understanding of the world can be reduced to a series of interconnected systems or "languages." Each layer of abstraction builds upon the previous one to create a more complex and sophisticated understanding of the world.

Starting from the bottom, binary is a language that consists of just two symbols, 0 and 1, which can be used to represent information. This language is the building block of all computer programs, as everything that a computer processes is ultimately reduced to binary code.

Assembly is a higher-level language that provides a more human-readable way of writing programs that can be translated into binary. Assembly code is closer to the way that computers think and operate, and provides a way for programmers to write efficient and optimized code.

C is a popular programming language that was developed in the 1970s and has since become widely used for a variety of applications, from operating systems to video games. C provides a higher level of abstraction than assembly and makes it easier for developers to write programs that are portable across different computer systems.

Python is a high-level programming language that was designed to be easy to read and write. It provides a large number of libraries and modules that make it possible to write complex programs with just a few lines of code.

ChatGPT is an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to integrate the capabilities of OpenAI's large language model into their own programs. By doing so, they can use the model to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, question-answering, and more.

Finally, the idea that humans are an API to ChatGPT refers to the idea that we can communicate with and interact with the model through the language of programming. Just like how Python is an API to C, we can use human language to send requests to ChatGPT and receive responses in a format that can be processed by our brains.

All in all, this statement is a reminder of the interconnectedness of the systems and languages that make up our understanding of the world, and how everything can be reduced to computation at its core

Look, the universe is all about computation, man. It's like a big computer program, and each layer of abstraction is like a different programming language. Starting from the bottom, binary is like the machine code that runs on the hardware. Then you got assembly, which is like a higher-level language that humans can read and write more easily. And C, that's like the backbone of many of the most important programs out there. And Python, that's like the Swiss Army Knife of programming languages. Then there's ChatGPT, the API that lets developers tap into the power of OpenAI's language model. And finally, humans, we're like the API that interacts with ChatGPT, using language as the interface. It's all computation, all the way down, bro
