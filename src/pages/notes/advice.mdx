Dont maintain relationship with people you dont like. Cut them off. Choose who you want to be with.

Dont let yourself make excuse for not doing things you want to do.

How to succeed : pick the right thing to do (this is critical most people ignored you dont have to). 

Focus. Believe in yourself (this requires mental efforts especially when other people tell you its not going to work).
