Introduction
Welcome to Pulse, the groundbreaking hyperlocal delivery platform that is set to revolutionize the way we shop and support local businesses. Pulse seamlessly merges cutting-edge technology with everyday convenience, promising to transform the delivery landscape as we know it.

## Behind The Scenes: 
Harnessing the Power of Flutter and Laravel
At the core of Pulse's technological infrastructure lie two powerful tools: Flutter and Laravel. Flutter, Google's UI toolkit, enables the creation of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This means that Pulse delivers a consistent, high-quality user experience across all platforms, be it on your phone, tablet, or computer.

Complementing Flutter is Laravel, a robust PHP framework that powers the back-end services of Pulse. Laravel simplifies common tasks in web projects, including routing, security, and caching, allowing our developers to focus on crafting the unique features that make Pulse stand out.
