As technology continues to evolve, there is a real possibility that the current model of how applications are built will change dramatically in the next five years. The traditional model, without the use of AI, consists of a database, a front-end interface, and established user interaction models such as mobile apps and web pages. This model has evolved over time, allowing for a better understanding of how humans and machines communicate, but with the advent of AI, this model may be completely upended.

In the future, applications may become more of a dialogue between the computer and the user, where the user guides the machine on what to do and receives real-time feedback. This dialogue could take the form of written text, spoken words, or other forms of communication. The machine would then use this information to perform tasks and provide results, creating a loop of interaction between the computer and the user. This shift represents a significant change in the very fundamental assumptions about how software is built and may require the development of entirely new tools and technology stacks.

As a university student, it is important to consider the potential impact of AI on the future of software development. Despite its potential, some organizations may not yet have dedicated resources or funds focused specifically on AI technology. However, as the field continues to evolve, the use of AI in software development may become increasingly prevalent and have a significant impact on the way applications are built and used in the future.
