Why you should not compare yourself with others?

a thread on focusing yourself instead of world

1. Worldviews are often built on false assumptions:
   a zero-sum game and the belief that everyone's path will be the same.

People often fall into the trap of believing they can only be successful if they are better than others, based on the false assumption that the world is a zero-sum game. In reality, there are many opportunities available and it is possible for everyone to create their own wins.

2. Reality is that we all start off differently and end up differently, with many opportunities available.

People often make the false assumption that everyone's path will be the same, but this is not true. Each person is unique and has their own set of circumstances, leading to different outcomes for each individual. It is impossible for anyone to be exactly like another person.

3. Negative emotions can be used to motivate action instead of dwelling on what others have.

Feeling negative emotions when seeing others succeed is natural, but these emotions can be used as motivation to take action instead of being consumed by them. Using negative emotions as a driving force can help individuals achieve their goals.

4. Define your own success and reflect on actions taken to achieve it.

Defining personal success and reflecting on actions taken to achieve it is important, rather than comparing oneself to others. It is helpful to consider if all steps are being taken to reach personal goals and to make changes if necessary.

5. Don't compare yourself to others, focus on personal growth and learning.

Comparing oneself to others can be damaging to self-esteem and motivation. It is more helpful to focus on personal growth and learning, setting personal goals, and working towards them without worrying about comparisons.

6. Emotions are temporary and can be overcome by reminding oneself of own capabilities and potential.

Emotions are temporary and can be overcome by reminding oneself of personal capabilities and potential. This helps to stay focused on goals and overcome negative emotions.
