# why is owing equity in a business is important to become rich?

it’s ownership versus wage work. always remember this if you’re getting paid for renting out your time even lawyers and doctors you can make some money but you’re not going to make money that gives financial freedom.

**you’re not going to have a passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation.**

this is probably one of the most important points. people seem to think you can create **_wealth_**, and make money through work. personally, I have read and listened to thousands of podcasts and books. this is not gonna work at all and there are many reasons for that.

without ownership, your inputs are tied o your output in almost any salaried job even if one paying a lot per hour like a developer or a doctor you’re still putting in hours, and every hour you get gets paid.

most of the millionaires and billionaires now are tech guys who know how to code. they created something with their mind and with code that generates passive income for them while they’re sleeping this the most common way to get rich nowadays if you want to be learn how to code.

if you wanna build some physical product you have to grab some things build a physical factory and hire some people to run the machine and do sales in the world of software that’s actually not true if you know how to sell and how to build you’re unstoppable.

but **_building digital products_** are easy nowadays this is how you can create a small part of your wealth and generate revenue for yourself .oney at some point they own a piece of product, a business. that can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.

but usually, the real wealth is created by starting your own company or even by investing. in an investment firm they’re buying equity. These are the routes to create wealth it does'nt comes through the hours

hope you learn something new today.
